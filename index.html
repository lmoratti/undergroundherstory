The project aims to curate the history of Seattle's local bands, as told by the bands themselves, with community involvement. Frustrated by the lack of information and media presence for many of these bands, Lizzie envisioned a website that collects the band bios, member details, sound descriptions, and their personal histories. The goal of the project is to provide a platform for local bands to share their stories and descriptions without the need for polish or perfection. It aims to capture the essence of these bands and serve as a historical document for future generations. In an ever-changing music landscape, where online content can easily disappear, the project seeks to preserve the legacy and narratives of these bands. The name 'undergroundherstory' reflects the focus on the often overlooked and underground music scene, specifically in the context of women's contributions. While critique of the name is not currently accepted, the project aims to celebrate and give voice to underrepresented artists. In terms of design, the project aims to recreate the aesthetic of late 90s to early 2000s websites, using basic HTML elements, color palettes, and occasionally low-resolution but amusing edits. The project is indeed open source, with the intention of encouraging collaboration and community involvement. By joining a union, participants can support the maintainer, Lizzie, and contribute to the project's development. If you have a band and would like to be featured on the website, you can create a page using a basic HTML tutorial. Band information such as the name, sound description, first show, member names or handles, pictures, logos, art, and social media links can be included. To request the addition of your page, you can submit it on GitHub. As the project evolves, there may be a template or improved accessibility options provided. For contacting Lizzie, you can reach her through Instagram (@lizzmoratti) or via GitHub. The site itself is open source, allowing anyone to contribute and improve its pages. ");

    	<h1> What the heck is this </h1>
      	<p>
      seattle local bands history as told by themselves. <i> curation by community.</i> <strong> fuck AI. </strong>
    	</p>
    <hr />

    	<h1>whats the goal of this </h1>
    	<p> 
    		this was started by lizzie who knows almost nothing about music besides it sounds neat. her friend meg gave her some local bands in a spotify playlist and lizzie realized there was no way to find information on most of them because their media presence was small and there was limited articles about them. she wished there was a website that collected bios of local bands, their members, how they describe themselves & their sound, and their history.
    	</p>
		<p> 
			there exists many bands who deserve a space to tell their stories, describe themselves, and not need to worry about it being polished or even good -- just unfiltered and what it is. in 10 years the entire local music landscape will have changed and the only thingss that will remain might be scattered to the wind as we've seen with old websites and social media sites from the early 2000s and the stories of bands that were mainstream enough to capture sufficient traditional media attention. i hope a site like this can serve as a historical document that <u><i>we were here.</i></u>
		</p>

		<p>
			this project is for everyone else -- collaboratively and grassroots-ly documented by the community itself. backed up into an archive for future generations.

    	<h1>neato.</h1>
    	<p>thanks. here are the bands: </p>
    	<ul>
    	<li><a href="./band/beautifulfreaks/">Beautiful Freaks</a></li>

    	</ul>
    	
    	<hr />

    	<h1>whats the theme-ing</h1>
    	<p>
    		this is TBD, i really want it to look like late 90s - early 2000s websites that used basic html elements, color palletes, and sometimes low res but hilarious edits.
    	</p>
    	<hr />

    	<h1> is this really opensource</h1>
    	<p>
    		yes, i am but one person but through union we are many. join a union. save a maintainer (<a href="https://github.com/lmoratti/undergroundherstory">me, save me </a>).
    	</p>
    	<hr />

    	<h1>i want a page for my band</h1>
    	<p>
    		yooo make a page using basic html tutorial to get started like this one. You can request to add it to the github. Eventually I might have more of a template or something cause user accessibility matters. Avoid overly flashing GIFs that might trigger seizures too.
	<p> it should have at least the following information, displayed in any way you like: <p>
	<ul> 
		<li class="check"> band name</li>
		<li class="check">  all the history about how you got here you can find or make</li>
		<li class="check">  how do you describe your sound</li>
		<li class="check">  what was your first show</li>
		<li class="check">  band members (names or handles)</li>
		<li class="check">  pictures of you playing</li>
		<li class="check">  any logos or art you got</li>
		<li class="check">  social media plugs</li>
		<li class="check">  shoutouts to your inspirations or bands</li>
	</ul>
